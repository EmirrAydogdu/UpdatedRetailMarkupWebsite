            "question": "What is the difference between omnichannel strategy and multichannel?",
            "answer": "Multichannel is a structure where each channel operates independently, and there is usually no connection between channels. Omnichannel, on the other hand, offers an integrated experience where customers can seamlessly continue their journey across platforms."
        },
        "questions2": {
            "question": "What is the impact of omnichannel strategy on customer experience?",
            "answer": "With omnichannel, customers enjoy a seamless experience during their shopping journey. For example, a customer can view a product on the website, find the same product in a physical store, or pick up an online order from the store. This approach increases satisfaction and loyalty."
        },
        "questions3": {
            "question": "What advantages does the omnichannel approach provide for businesses?",
            "answer": "Omnichannel improves customer experience, increases sales, builds customer loyalty, and ensures consistent brand identity across all channels. It also enables better analysis of customer behaviors for strategic decision-making."
        },
        "questions4": {
            "question": "How does omnichannel strategy increase profitability?",
            "answer": "With omnichannel, customer lifetime value (CLV) increases. Customers shop more frequently and through different channels, resulting in overall revenue growth. Additionally, customer acquisition costs (CAC) become more efficient."
        },
        "questions5": {
            "question": "How does omnichannel strategy boost sales?",
            "answer": "Omnichannel simplifies shopping by offering customers a seamless experience across all channels. This increases the likelihood of shopping and optimizes cross-sell and up-sell opportunities."
